    <p>
        This is practice so that I am able to better understand HTML and how it works. I will practice using elements to
        set up my index page.

    <p>
        I will also learn how to include styling by way of CSS. It will make the page look better and not so plain.

                    This section is about me! I am Amber and I love all things tech. I have been intrigued with the technology
                    industry since I was first introduced to it in 2018. I continue to practice with the hopes of being a great developer. Check out some of my work <a href="https://github.com/Athubbard"></a>.
